NAME
    Text::Trim - remove leading and/or trailing whitespace from strings

SYNOPSIS
        use Text::Trim;

        $text = "\timportant data\n";
        $data = trim $text;
        # now $data contains "important data" and $text is unchanged
    
        # or:
        trim $text; # work in-place, $text now contains "important data"

        @lines = <STDIN>;
        rtrim @lines; # remove trailing whitespace from all lines

        # Alternatively:
        @lines = rtrim <STDIN>;

        # Or even:
        while (<STDIN>) {
            trim; # Change $_ in place
            # ...
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides functions for removing leading and/or trailing
    whitespace from strings. It is basically a wrapper around some simple
    regexes with a flexible context-based interface.

EXPORTS
    All functions are exported by default.

CONTEXT HANDLING
  void context
    Functions called in void context change their arguments in-place

        trim(@strings); # All strings in @strings are trimmed in-place

        ltrim($text); # remove leading whitespace on $text

        rtrim; # remove trailing whitespace on $_

    No changes are made to arguments in non-void contexts.

  list context
    Values passed in are changed and returned without affecting the
    originals.

        @result = trim(@strings); # @strings is unchanged

        @result = rtrim; # @result contains rtrimmed $_

        ($result) = ltrim(@strings); # like $result = ltrim($strings[0]);

  scalar context
    As list context but multiple arguments are stringified before being
    returned. Single arguments are unaffected. This means that under these
    circumstances, the value of $" ($LIST_SEPARATOR) is used to join the
    values. If you don't want this, make sure you only use single arguments
    when calling in scalar context.

        @strings = ("\thello\n", "\tthere\n");
        $trimmed = trim(@strings);
        # $trimmed = "hello there"

        local $" = ', ';
        $trimmed = trim(@strings);
        # Now $trimmed = "hello, there"

        $trimmed = rtrim;
        # $trimmed = $_ minus trailing whitespace

FUNCTIONS
  trim
    Removes leading and trailing whitespace from all arguments, or $_ if
    none are provided.

  rtrim
    Like trim() but removes only trailing (right) whitespace.

  ltrim
    Like trim() but removes only leading (left) whitespace.

UNICODE
    Because this module is implemented using perl regular expressions, it is
    capable of recognising and removing unicode whitespace characters (such
    as non-breaking spaces) from scalars with the utf8 flag on. See Encode
    for details about the utf8 flag.

    Note that this only applies in the case of perl versions after 5.8.0 or
    so.

SEE ALSO
    Brent B. Powers' String::Strip performs a similar function in XS.
